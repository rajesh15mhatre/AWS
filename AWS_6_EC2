# Section 6: EC2 -Solutions Architect Level 
## 46 Private vs Public vs Elastic IP
- 2 sort of IPs 
  - IPv4: 1.168.12.123
  - IPv6: 1244:2323:2:200:f4ff:f3er:545Ccv
- IPv4 is the most common format used online
- IPv6 is newer and solves problems for the IoT
- IPv4 allows for 3.7 billion different address in thepublic space
- IPv4: [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]
- Company machine connects to www using NAT + internet gateway (a proxy)
- Only a specified range of IPs can be used as provate IP
- When you start and stop VM IPV4 changes 
- We can use elastic IP **chargable service** to keep static public IP for VM
- We can have 5 elastic IP in your account (we cal also ask AWS to increase that)
- Avoid using Elastic IP
  - They often reflect poor architecture
  - Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it 
  - WE can also use load balancer
- By default VM comenrs with Private and public IP
- USe public IP while SSH
## 47. Private vs Public vs Elastic IP Hands on
- creaete VM, connect it by ssh, stop VM , see IP changes , ssh usign old and new IP, attache elastic IP 
connect shh using elastic IP, start stop and see elatic IP is fixed, remove elastic IP 
- Elastic IP are not changable as ling as we don't use it
